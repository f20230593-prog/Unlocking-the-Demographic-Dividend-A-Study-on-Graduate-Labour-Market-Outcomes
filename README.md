# Unlocking-the-Demographic-Dividend-A-Study-on-Graduate-Labour-Market-Outcomes
This project examines graduate unemployment in India, exploring the complex relationship between education, gender disparities, and employment trends. It analyzes how skill mismatches, outdated curricula, and regional economic differences contribute to high unemployment and underemployment among graduates. Using data from 2004–05 to 2023–24, the study highlights variations in labour force participation, workforce participation, and unemployment rates across states, genders, religions, and social groups. It also assesses the impact of India’s demographic dividend, regional disparities, and policy interventions such as skill development programs and employment schemes. The findings underscore the urgent need for targeted reforms, industry-aligned education, and inclusive growth strategies to better integrate graduates into the workforce and harness India’s economic potential.
